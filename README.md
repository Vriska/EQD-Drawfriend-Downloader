# PonyScrape - 

This is a scraper that downloads artwork from EQD's Drawfriend thread designed for non programmers . It accepts the month , year of creation of the thread and downloads all drawthreads from that point to some point an inputed n months later . Precise selection of month / week / artwork is possible but not recommended and not defaulted . This is because of the fact that there aren't a fixed number of threads a month so what might be your drawfriend #2535 can be Art Showcase #257 .


This is built using BeautifulSoup4 and Requests . An exe of the same has been made using pyinstaller .
