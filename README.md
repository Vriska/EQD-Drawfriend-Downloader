The first drawfriend on https://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Drawfriend?updated-max=2017-1-19T17:00:00-07:00&max-results=32&start=20&by-date=false is referenced as year = 2017 , month = 1 and thread = 1 . The pics are referenced by their serail number on the drawthread . The second drawfriend on the same URL is referecned as year = 2017  , month = 1 and thread = 2 .


The draw threads of different years\months may be referred to by changing the year ,month (updated-max=2017(year)-1(month) in above example) in the URL above .


Number of months forward refers to how many months worth of draw threads are to be downloaded from that reference point . 

An exe of the same has been made using pyinstaller .
